; Checkerboard: the CPU plans the next square while the blitter fills this one
; An 8 x 6 board of 80 x 80 squares. The CPU starts a square, then works out the next square's position and
; colour while the blitter paints, and only then waits. That overlap is what a coprocessor is for.
; Memory 0: x, 1: y, 2: colour.
