# Your first machine

In this tutorial you start from the smallest CPU ExµArch can make, give it a display, and write the one instruction it needs to print. By the end it says "Hi". The next tutorials keep building on this machine, so keep it open.

## Start from the minimal CPU

1. Click **New…** at the top, pick **Minimal CPU**, give it a name and click **Create**.

The minimal CPU is a program counter `pc`, a memory `mem`, the instruction register `ir`, a status register `status` and a clock `clk`, all on one bus called `main`. Its microcode has a fetch routine and three instructions: `NOP`, `JMP` and `HLT`. It runs, but it has no way to show anything.

## Add a display

1. Open [Hardware design](<exuarch:tab/Hardware design>).
2. Drag **display** from the palette onto the canvas, next to the bus. It connects to the nearest bus by itself.
3. With the new device selected, set its **ID** to `lcd` in the inspector on the right.

A [display](exuarch:reference/display) is a character LCD. It has one input line that matters here, `load`: in the tick it is on, the display takes the low 8 bits of the bus and prints them as a character at its cursor, then moves the cursor on. The ID is how microcode names the device, so its load line is now `lcd.load`.

## Write the OUT instruction

1. Open [Microcode](exuarch:tab/Microcode) and click **＋ Instruction**.
2. Set **Mnemonic** to `OUT`, **Operands** to 1 and the operand type to **value**.
3. Give it two steps. The new instruction starts with one step holding `ir.reset`; click **＋ Add step** for the second, and move the signals so the steps read:
   - step 1: `pc.output` `mem.loadmar`
   - step 2: `mem.output` `lcd.load` `pc.inc` `ir.reset`

Type a signal into the *add device.line* field of the selected step, or click it in the control lines palette. What the steps do:

- By the time `OUT`'s own steps start, the fetch routine has already loaded the opcode and moved the program counter past it, so `pc` points at the operand.
- **Step 1**: the program counter drives its value onto the bus (`pc.output`) and the memory takes it as the address to read (`mem.loadmar`).
- **Step 2**: the memory drives the operand onto the bus (`mem.output`) and the display prints it (`lcd.load`). In the same tick `pc.inc` steps past the operand, and `ir.reset` ends the instruction, so the next tick starts fetch again.

A step is one clock tick. In every tick the devices whose output line is on drive the bus first, and then the devices whose load lines are on take the value, which is why one step can both put a value on the bus and store it.

## Write the program

1. Open [Program](exuarch:tab/Program) and replace the starter program with:

```asm
        OUT 'H'
        OUT 'i'
        HLT
```

`'H'` is a character literal: the assembler stores its character code, 72, in the cell after `OUT`'s opcode.

## Run it

1. Open [Run](exuarch:tab/Run) and press **Tick** (→) a few times.
2. Open the **Trace** tab below the machine.

Each row of the trace is one tick: the micro step that ran (such as `OUT.2`), what moved over the bus and which signals were on. The first two rows of each instruction are fetch; then come `OUT`'s two steps, and an `H` appears on the LCD. The whole program takes 11 ticks: four for each `OUT` (two of fetch and two of its own) and three for `HLT`, whose one step stops the clock.

Press **⟲ Reset** and try **Instruction** (Shift+→), which runs a whole instruction at a time.
