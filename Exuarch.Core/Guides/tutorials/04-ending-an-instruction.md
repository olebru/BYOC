# Ending an instruction

`HLT` from [Opcodes are addresses](exuarch:guide/opcodes-are-addresses) ends by stopping the clock. Every other instruction has to end by sending the counter back to fetch. In this tutorial you write `NOP` and `JMP`, and see what happens when the counter is not sent anywhere.

## 1. Write NOP

1. In [Microcode](exuarch:tab/Microcode), click **＋ Instruction** and set the mnemonic to `NOP`.
2. Keep its one step, `ir.reset`.

`NOP` is opcode 3, after `HLT`. `ir.reset` is the counter's clear pin: at the end of the tick `ir` becomes 0, and the next tick reads the first step of fetch.

## 2. Run two NOPs

1. Change the program to:

```asm
        NOP
        NOP
        HLT
```

2. Run it. Memory holds `0003 0003 0002`.

It takes 9 ticks: fetch and `NOP` twice, then fetch and `HLT`.

## 3. Forget ir.load

What makes the machine follow the program?

1. Remove `ir.load` from fetch's step 2.

The editor warns that `FETCH` never resets or loads `ir`, so it runs on into the next instruction's microcode.

2. Run the program again.

It halts after 3 ticks, and the `NOP`s never run. Without the load, `ir` counts 0, 1, 2, and address 2 is `HLT`, whatever memory says. The opcodes in memory only matter because `ir.load` puts them into the counter.

3. Put `ir.load` back.

## 4. Write JMP

`JMP` reads the cell after its opcode and makes it the program counter.

1. Click **＋ Instruction**, set the mnemonic to `JMP`, **Operands** to 1 and the operand type to **address**.
2. Give it two steps:
   - step 1: `pc.output` `mem.loadmar`
   - step 2: `mem.output` `pc.load` `ir.reset`

`JMP` is opcode 4. It is fetch with one change: the value from memory goes into `pc` (`pc.load`) instead of `ir`. Fetch has already moved `pc` past the opcode, so step 1 sends out the operand's address.

## 5. Loop for ever

1. Change the program to:

```asm
loop:   NOP
        JMP loop
```

`loop:` is a label for address 0. Memory holds `0003 0004 0000`.

2. Run it with **Space**, and pause with **Space**.

It never halts. `NOP` takes three ticks and `JMP` four, and then `pc` is back at 0.

## 6. The whole ROM

1. Check **whole ROM** in the **Decoder ROM** tab.

Each row is one address and each column one control line:

| Address | Step | Lines on |
|---|---|---|
| `00000` | `FETCH.1` | `pc.output` `mem.loadmar` |
| `00001` | `FETCH.2` | `mem.output` `ir.load` `pc.inc` |
| `00002` | `HLT.1` | `clk.disable` |
| `00003` | `NOP.1` | `ir.reset` |
| `00004` | `JMP.1` | `pc.output` `mem.loadmar` |
| `00005` | `JMP.2` | `mem.output` `pc.load` `ir.reset` |

Every program this machine runs is these six words, picked in the order the counter and memory decide.
