# Opcodes are addresses

The machine from [Fetch](exuarch:guide/fetch-routine) can read opcodes, but the only one it knows is 0, fetch itself. In this tutorial you add `HLT` and see what an opcode really is: the ROM address where an instruction's steps begin.

## 1. Where instructions go in the ROM

Fetch starts at address 0. Each instruction you add gets as many addresses as it has steps, right after the one before. Fetch has two steps, at 0 and 1, so the next instruction starts at 2.

## 2. Write HLT

1. In [Microcode](exuarch:tab/Microcode), click **＋ Instruction** and set **Mnemonic** to `HLT`.
2. The new instruction has one step holding `ir.reset`. Remove it and add `clk.disable`.

Look at the number next to `HLT` in the list: `HLT` is opcode 2, the next free address.

## 3. Write the program

1. Open [Program](exuarch:tab/Program) and write:

```asm
        HLT
```

2. Open [Run](exuarch:tab/Run) and the **Memory** tab.

Cell 0 holds `0002`. The assembler turned the mnemonic into its opcode, and that number is all the program is.

## 4. Step through it

1. Open the **Trace** tab and press **Tick** until the machine halts. It takes 3 ticks:

- `FETCH.1`: `pc → main 0000 → mem`. The address goes out.
- `FETCH.2`: `mem → main 0002 → ir`. The opcode goes into the counter.
- `HLT.1`: `clk.disable` stops the clock. **Tick** does nothing until you reset.

## 5. Watch the ROM address

1. Press **⟲ Reset** and open the **Decoder ROM** tab.
2. Tick through again.

The highlighted row moves `FETCH.1`, `FETCH.2`, `HLT.1`, and the address bits show 0, 1, 2.

## 6. The whole address

The address has more bits than the counter:

```
bit   20 19 18 17 16 | 15 14 13 ...  2  1  0
       I  N  V  C  Z |  the 16 bits of ir
```

The low 16 bits come from `ir`. The top 5 are the flags in `status` and the interrupt request. Here they are all 0, so the address is just `ir`.

When an ALU sets the Z flag later on, step 3 is read from `10003` instead of `00003`: a separate copy of the ROM for that flag. That is how a conditional jump picks its steps, in [Loops and flags](exuarch:guide/loops-and-flags).
