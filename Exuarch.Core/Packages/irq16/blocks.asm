; Falling blocks: the classic game of seven pieces, on interrupts
; Set the clock to 250 kHz, which it is timed for, and capture the keyboard on the keypad panel. Then left and
; right move, up turns, down drops faster, space drops.
; A full row clears; four at once score the most. Every ten rows the level goes up and the pieces fall faster.
; Interrupts do the timing. The timer (irq0) counts down three counters: when the piece next falls, when a held
; arrow repeats, and when a held down arrow drops it again. The blitter (irq2) says when it has finished a
; square, so the next can start. The main loop reads the keys and moves the piece.
; The well is 10 squares by 20, each 20 pixels, at 220, 40 on the screen. Memory 3500-3699 holds it row by
; row, 0 for an empty square or the colour of the piece that landed there, and 3700-3899 what the screen shows
; there, so that after rows go only the squares that changed are drawn again. The stack sits above them.
