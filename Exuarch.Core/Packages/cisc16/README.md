# CISC-16

[RISC-16](exuarch:package/RISC-16)'s opposite. RISC-16 only reaches memory through `LDR` and `STR`, and does arithmetic in registers. CISC-16 lets almost every instruction reach memory, in any of six ways, and does as much work per instruction as it can: one `MOV_PP` copies a character from one string to another and steps both pointers on. This is how the VAX, the 68000 and x86 were built, and why they were.

## The idea

An operand says not only what, but where. CISC-16 has six **addressing modes**. Because the assembler has no brackets, the modes are part of the mnemonic: one letter for the destination, then one for the source.

| Letter | Mode | Operands | Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| `I` | immediate | a value | the number itself (sources only) |
| `R` | register | Rn | the register |
| `A` | absolute | a label | the cell at that address |
| `N` | register indirect | Rn | the cell Rn points at, `[Rn]` |
| `X` | indexed | Rn, d | the cell at Rn + d, `[Rn + d]`; d can be negative |
| `P` | post-increment | Rn | `[Rn]`, then Rn steps on by one |

So `ADD_RX R0, R6, -1` is R0 = R0 + [R6 - 1], and `MOV_AR total, R0` stores R0 at `total`. [MOV](exuarch:instruction/MOV_RR), [ADD](exuarch:instruction/ADD_RR), [SUB](exuarch:instruction/SUB_RR), [AND](exuarch:instruction/AND_RR) and [CMP](exuarch:instruction/CMP_RR) come in every pair of modes, 30 each. [PUSH](exuarch:instruction/PUSH_R) and [OUT](exuarch:instruction/OUT_R) take any source mode, and [POP](exuarch:instruction/POP_R) any destination. [LEA](exuarch:instruction/LEA) `Rd, label` loads an address rather than what is stored there, and [LEAX](exuarch:instruction/LEAX) `Rd, Rb, d` works one out.

The price is in the decoder. RISC-16 has 37 instructions; CISC-16 has 184, in 1,692 micro step addresses, because every combination of modes is its own microcode.

## The parts

- [The register file](exuarch:device/rf) holds R0 to R7, and [SP](exuarch:device/sp) points at the top of the stack, which grows down from the top of [memory](exuarch:device/mem).
- [EFFECTIVE ADDRESS](exuarch:device/ea) holds the address of a memory destination while the source is fetched, and [DESTINATION](exuarch:device/d) the number of a register destination.
- [The ALU](exuarch:device/alu) works on [ALU A](exuarch:device/x) and [ALU B](exuarch:device/y) and sets [FLAGS](exuarch:device/flags).
- [The address unit](exuarch:device/agu) is a second ALU, with its own inputs and its own flags, that only adds addresses: Rn + d for indexed operands, and the stack pointer for `ENTER` and `FREE`. Working out an address therefore never changes the flags a branch is about to test, which real CISC processors also take care of.

## How an instruction runs

An instruction finds its destination, reads it, finds and reads its source, and writes the result back. With fetch, `ADD_RR R0, R1` takes 10 ticks. `ADD_RX R0, R1, 2` takes 14, because the address unit first adds R1 and 2. `ADD_XX R0, 1, R1, 2` takes 19, with two addresses to work out and a memory cell to read and write. RISC-16's `ADD R0, R1, R2` takes 12, but a program needs extra `LDR` and `STR` instructions around it to do the same work on memory. `MOV_PP R2, R1` takes 11 for a load, a store and two increments.

## Stack frames

A function that calls itself needs its own copy of its arguments and local variables at every level. [ENTER](exuarch:instruction/ENTER) `R6, n` builds a **stack frame**: it pushes the caller's frame pointer, points R6 at the new frame and makes room for n locals below it. [LEAVE](exuarch:instruction/LEAVE) `R6` takes it down again. With the argument pushed by the caller and the return address pushed by [CALL](exuarch:instruction/CALL), a frame reads:

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `[R6 + 2]` | the argument |
| `[R6 + 1]` | the return address |
| `[R6]` | the caller's R6 |
| `[R6 - 1]` | the local |

After the call returns, [FREE](exuarch:instruction/FREE) `1` drops the argument. This is the frame x86 builds with `ENTER`, `LEAVE` and EBP.

## Things to try

1. [Sum a table](<exuarch:program/Sum a table>) adds the table with `ADD_RP R0, R1`, one instruction per value, prints `150`, and stores the sum at `total` with an absolute destination.
2. [Copy a string](<exuarch:program/Copy a string>) copies with `MOV_PP R2, R1`, checks the character it just copied with `CMP_XI R2, -1, 0`, and prints the copy, `Copied by MOV_PP`, with `OUT_P R1`.
3. Step [Recursive Fibonacci](<exuarch:program/Recursive Fibonacci>) with the **Memory** tab on the last page and watch the frames stack up. It prints `0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55` in 49,831 ticks, and while working out fib(10) the stack reaches 40 cells deep: ten frames of four.
4. Write the sum on RISC-16, and count the instructions and the ticks.
5. Add an `M` mode, pre-decrement, `[Rn]` after Rn steps back by one, and use it to fill a table backwards.
